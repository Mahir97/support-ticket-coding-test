# Thank you for considering my application

I apologize for this very basic version of the task but I received the mail a little late since it got lost in spam. So I had 2 days to somehow complete this admittedly simple task. I used the default breeze login and register functions. Ideally, the registration page should not hate the option to choose user type, but I thought a seeder solution would be unnecessary for a test project. 

The Web Application is pretty self explanatory. Register users as either "**user**" or "**admin**". The dashboard will be dynamically created for both types. Users will be able create tickets and observe its status in tabular form. With the reply to the ticket also being visible in the table. When their ticket has been addressed they will be notified via email.

The Admins, however many created will have a table on their dashboard displaying all the tickets created by users. Every single admin will get an email notification whenever a ticket has been raised. They have the ability to reply to each ticket on a separate page. Closed tickets will disappear from the table, keeping only the unaddressed ones visible.

I hope I have satisfied your needs and you will consider me for this position!
